# Django Template
Django Template is a simple Django app template that comes equipped with a landing page, authentication functionality, and a dashboard. 

It was designed to save developers time and frustration when creating new Django applications, by providing a pre-built foundation with some of the most common features already in place.

## Features
This Django Template project is extremely barebones and comes with three pre-built apps: **landing_page**, **auth**, and **dashboard**. 

The landing page serves as a homepage for your application and can be customized to fit your needs. The authentication app provides a user registration, login and logout functionality, while the dashboard app provides a customizable dashboard interface.

## Installation
To use Django Template, simply clone the project from Github and install the dependencies. You can then customize the project as you see fit and build on top of the pre-built features.

## Usage
After installing Django Template, you can use it as a starting point for your Django application. You can customize the landing page, authentication, and dashboard apps to fit the specific needs of your application. The pre-built foundation provides a solid starting point that you can build on top of, without having to start from scratch.
